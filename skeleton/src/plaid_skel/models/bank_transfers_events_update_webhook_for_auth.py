To begin receiving this webhook, you must first register your webhook listener endpoint via the [webhooks page in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/webhooks). The `BANK_TRANSFERS_EVENTS_UPDATE` webhook can be used to track the progress of ACH transfers used in [micro-deposit verification](/docs/auth/coverage/microdeposit-events/). Receiving this webhook indicates you should fetch the new events from `/bank_transfer/event/sync`. Note that [Transfer](https://plaid.com/docs/transfer) customers should use Transfer webhooks instead of using `BANK_TRANSFERS_EVENTS_UPDATE`; see [micro-deposit events documentation](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/microdeposit-events/) for more details."""
