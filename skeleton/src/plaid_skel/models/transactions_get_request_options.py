In those cases, the field controls the maximum number of days of transaction history that Plaid will request from the financial institution. The more transaction history is requested, the longer the historical update poll will take. If no value is specified, 90 days of history will be requested by default. If a value under 30 is provided, a minimum of 30 days of history will be requested.  If you are initializing your Items with transactions during the `/link/token/create` call (e.g. by including `transactions` in the `/link/token/create` `products` array), you must use the [`transactions.days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) field in the `/link/token/create` request instead of in the `/transactions/get` request.  If the Item has already been initialized with the Transactions product, this field will have no effect. The maximum amount of transaction history to request on an Item cannot be updated if Transactions has already been added to the Item. To request older transaction history on an Item where Transactions has already been added, you must delete the Item via `/item/remove` and send the user through Link to create a new Item.  Customers using [Recurring Transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrecurringget) should request at least 180 days of history for optimal results.")
