class UserAccountRevokedWebhook(BaseModel):
    """The `USER_ACCOUNT_REVOKED` webhook is fired when an end user has revoked access to their account on the Data Provider's portal. This webhook is currently sent only for PNC Items, but may be sent in the future for other financial institutions that allow account-level permissions revocation through their portals. Upon receiving this webhook, it is recommended to delete any Plaid-derived data you have stored that is associated with the revoked account.  If you are using Auth and receive this webhook, this webhook indicates that the TAN associated with the revoked account is no longer valid and cannot be used to create new transfers. You should not create new ACH transfers for the account that was revoked until access has been re-granted.  You can request the user to re-grant access to their account by sending them through [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode). Alternatively, they may re-grant access directly through the Data Provider's portal.  After the user has re-granted access, Auth customers should call the auth endpoint again to obtain the new TAN."""
