A `PRODUCT_READY` webhook will be fired for each Asset Report when it is ready, and the `report_type` field will indicate whether the webhook is firing for the `full` or `fast` Asset Report. To retrieve the Fast Asset Report, call `/asset_report/get` with `fast_report` set to `true`. There is no additional charge for using Fast Assets. To create a Fast Asset Report, Plaid must successfully retrieve both Identity and Balance data; if Plaid encounters an error obtaining this data, the Fast Asset Report will not be created. However, as long as Plaid can obtain Transactions data, the Full Asset Report will still be available.  When Investments is requested, `investments` must be specified in the `optional_products` array when initializing Link.")
