    """Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead."""
