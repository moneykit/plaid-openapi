When initializing with Identity Verification, this field is not used; for more details, see [Identity Verification supported languages](https://plaid.com/docs/identity-verification/#supported-languages).

    country_codes: List[CountryCode] = Field( description="Specify an array of Plaid-supported country codes using the ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code standard. Institutions from all listed countries will be shown. For a complete mapping of supported products by country, see https://plaid.com/global/. By default, access is granted to US and CA. For Production or Limited Production access to other countries, [contact Sales](https://plaid.com/contact/) or your account manager.    If using Identity Verification, `country_codes` should be set to the country where your company is based, not the country where your user is located. For all other products, `country_codes` represents the location of your user's financial institution.  If Link is launched with multiple country codes, only products that you are enabled for in all countries will be used by Link. While all countries are enabled by default in Sandbox, in Production only the countries you have requested access for are shown. To request access to additional countries, [file a product access Support ticket](https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/product-and-development/product-troubleshooting/request-product-access) via the Plaid dashboard.  If using a Link customization, make sure the country codes in the customization match those specified in `country_codes`, or the customization may not be applied.  If using the Auth features Instant Match, Instant Micro-deposits, Same-day Micro-deposits, Automated Micro-deposits, or Database Auth, `country_codes` must be set to `['US']`.")

For more details, see [new User APIs](https://plaid.com/docs/api/users/user-apis). One of either the `user_id` or the `user` field is required.")
    products: Optional[List[Products]] = Field(default=None, description="List of Plaid product(s) that the linked Item must support. If launching Link in update mode, should be omitted (unless you are using update mode to add a credit product, such as Assets, Statements, Income, or Plaid Check Consumer Report, to an existing Item); at least one `product` is required otherwise.  To maximize the number of institutions and accounts available, initialize Link with the minimal product set required for your use case, as the products specified will limit which institutions and account types will be available to your users in Link. Only institutions that support *all* requested products can be selected; if a user attempts to select an institution that does not support a listed product, a \"Connectivity not supported\" error message will appear in Link. For each specified product, the Item connected by the user must contain at least one compatible account. For details on compatible product / account type combinations, see [the account type/product support matrix](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#account-type--product-support-matrix).  To add products without limiting the institution list or account types, use the [`optional_products`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-optional-products) or  [`required_if_supported_products`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-required-if-supported-products) fields. Products can also be added to an Item by calling the product endpoint after obtaining an access token; this may require the product to be listed in the [`additional_consented_products`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-additional-consented-products) array. For details, see [Choosing when to initialize products](https://plaid.com/docs/link/initializing-products/).  `balance` is *not* a valid value, the Balance product does not require explicit initialization and will automatically be initialized when any other product is initialized.  If launching Link with CRA products, `cra_base_reports` is required and must be included in the `products` array.  Note that, unless you have opted to disable Instant Match support, institutions that support Instant Match will also be shown in Link if `auth` is specified as a product, even though these institutions do not contain `auth` in their product array.  In Production, you will be billed for each product that you specify when initializing Link. Note that a product cannot be removed from an Item once the Item has been initialized with that product. To stop billing on an Item for subscription-based products, such as Liabilities, Investments, and Transactions, remove the Item via `/item/remove`.")

Institutions that do not support these products will still be shown in Link. The products will only be extracted and billed if the user selects an institution and account type that supports them.  There should be no overlap between this array and the `products`, `optional_products`, or `additional_consented_products` arrays. The `products` array must have at least one product.

There should be no overlap between this array and the `products`, `required_if_supported_products`, or `additional_consented_products` arrays. The `products` array must have at least one product.

These products will not be billed until you start using them by calling the relevant endpoints.  `balance` is *not* a valid value, the Balance product does not require explicit initialization and will automatically have consent collected.  Institutions that do not support these products will still be shown in Link.  There should be no overlap between this array and the `products` or `required_if_supported_products` arrays.  If you include `signal` in `additional_consented_products`, you will need to call [`/signal/prepare`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/signal/#signalprepare) before calling `/signal/evaluate` for the first time on an Item in order to get the most accurate results. For more details, see [`/signal/prepare`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/signal/#signalprepare).")

When used in Production, must be an https URI. To specify any subdomain, use `*` as a wildcard character, e.g. `https://*.example.com/oauth.html`. Note that any redirect URI must also be added to the Allowed redirect URIs list in the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api).
