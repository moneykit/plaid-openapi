By default, a `link_token` created to generate a `public_token` that will be exchanged for a new `access_token` expires after 4 hours, and a `link_token` created for an existing Item (such as when updating an existing `access_token` by launching Link in update mode) expires after 30 minutes. If using [Hosted Link](https://plaid.com/docs/link/hosted-link/), the `link_token` will expire at the same time as the Hosted Link URL, and you can customize the duration using the `hosted_link.url_lifetime_seconds` option in the request. If using Link Delivery (beta), the `link_token` will expire by default after 24 hours if sent via SMS and after 7 days if sent via email. If using Identity Verification, Link token expiration will not be enforced; an Identity Verification Link session can be created with an expired Link token.")

Integrations that began using `/user/create` after December 10, 2025 use this field to identify a user instead of the `user_token`.
