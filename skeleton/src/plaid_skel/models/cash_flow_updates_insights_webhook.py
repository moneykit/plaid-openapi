This webhook will not fire immediately upon enrollment in Cash Flow Updates. Upon receiving the webhook, call `/cra/monitoring_insights/get` to retrieve the updated insights. At approximately the same time as the `INSIGHTS_UPDATED` webhook, any event-driven `CASH_FLOW_UPDATES` webhooks (e.g. `LOW_BALANCE_DETECTED`, `LARGE_DEPOSIT_DETECTED`) that were triggered by the update will also fire.
