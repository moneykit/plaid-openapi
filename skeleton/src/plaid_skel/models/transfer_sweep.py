    """Describes a sweep of funds to / from the sweep account.  A sweep is associated with many sweep events (events of type `swept` or `return_swept`) which can be retrieved by invoking the `/transfer/event/list` endpoint with the corresponding `sweep_id`.  `swept` events occur when the transfer amount is credited or debited from your sweep account, depending on the `type` of the transfer. `return_swept` events occur when a transfer is returned and Plaid undoes the credit or debit.  The total sum of the `swept` and `return_swept` events is equal to the `amount` of the sweep Plaid creates and matches the amount of the entry on your sweep account ledger."""
