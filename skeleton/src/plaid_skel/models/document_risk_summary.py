You can automatically reject documents with a high risk score, automatically accept documents with a low risk score, and manually review documents in between. We suggest starting with a threshold of 80 for auto-rejection and 20 for auto-acceptance. As you gather more data points on typical risk scores for your use case, you can tune these parameters to reduce the number of documents undergoing manual review.")
