If the reference provided through the API is not unique, Plaid will adjust it. Some institutions may limit the reference to less than 18 characters. If necessary, Plaid will adjust the reference by truncating it to fit the institution's requirements. Both the originally provided and automatically adjusted references (if any) can be found in the `reference` and `adjusted_reference` fields, respectively.")
